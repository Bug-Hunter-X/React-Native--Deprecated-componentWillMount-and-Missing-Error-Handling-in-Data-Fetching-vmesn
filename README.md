# React Native Bug: Deprecated componentWillMount and Missing Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common bug in React Native applications involving the use of the deprecated `componentWillMount` lifecycle method and the lack of proper error handling during data fetching.

The `bug.js` file contains the problematic code. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version using modern React lifecycle methods and improved error handling.

## Problem

The original code uses `componentWillMount` to fetch data and update the component's state.  This method is deprecated and can lead to unexpected behavior, particularly with asynchronous operations.  Additionally, the code lacks error handling, which can result in crashes or silent failures.

## Solution

The solution uses `useEffect` hook to fetch data and update the state.  It also includes proper error handling and loading states to provide a better user experience.
